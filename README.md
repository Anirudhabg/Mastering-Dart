# 🚀 Dart Programming Concepts

This repository contains well-structured examples and explanations of essential **Dart programming concepts**, from basic syntax to advanced object-oriented and asynchronous programming features.  
It serves as a quick reference and learning resource for beginners and intermediate developers exploring Dart.

## 📘 Topics Covered

### 🧩 1. Dart Operators
- Arithmetic, Relational, Logical, and Bitwise operators
- Assignment and Conditional operators
- Type test operators (`is`, `is!`, `as`)
- Null safe and Null Aware

### 🧱 2. Data Types
- Numbers, Strings, Booleans, Lists, Maps, Sets
- Dynamic and var types

### 🔁 3. Control Flow and Looping
- `if`, `else if`, `switch` statements
- `for`, `while`, `do-while` loops
- `break`, `continue`, and nested loop examples
- `try catch throw`, `assert` statements

### 🧮 4. Functions & Function Parameters
- Regular and anonymous functions
- Optional, and required parameters
- Arrow functions (`=>`) and higher-order functions

### 🧬 5. Generics
- Type parameters and constraints

### 🧠 6. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Classes and objects
- Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction and Encapsulation
- Method overriding and `super` keyword usage

### 🧾 7. Enums and Cascade Notation
- Enum declaration and use cases
- Cascade operator (`..`) for chaining operations

### 🏗️ 8. Constructors
- Default and Parameterized
- Named constructors
- Factory constructors

### 🧩 9. Interfaces
- Using classes as interfaces

### ⚙️ 10. Static Members
- Static variables and methods

### 🧩 11. Mixins
- Code reusability using mixins
- Combining multiple mixins in a class
- Restricting with `on` keyword

### ☎️ 12. Callable Classes
- Making classes callable like functions using `call()` method

### 📦 13. Imports and Packages
- Importing libraries and custom files
- Using `show` and `hide` keywords
- Prefixes to avoid confusions
- Working with external packages from [pub.dev](https://pub.dev)

### ⚡ 14. Asynchronous Programming
- Futures, async/await
- Isolates

### 🧪 15. Unit Testing
- Using the `test` package
- Writing simple and grouped tests
- Using `setUp()`, `expect()`, `group()` and `test()`
